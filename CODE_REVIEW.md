## File: remote_repo/Stan/Homepage.py

The provided Streamlit application script implements a text summarization and grammatical error correction tool using the LaMini-Flan-T5-248M model from the Transformers library. I'll review the code for functionality, best practices, and possible improvements:

### **Functional Parts:**

1. **Import Statements:**
   - The script correctly imports necessary libraries including `streamlit`, `transformers`, `torch`, and `base64`.

2. **Model and Tokenizer Loading:**
   - The `checkpoint` used is "LaMini-Flan-T5-248M". This is correctly loaded for both the `T5Tokenizer` and `T5ForConditionalGeneration`.
   - The model is initialized with device mapping for potential GPU utilization and setting the torch data type to `float32` for computation.

3. **Pipeline Creation:**
   - The `llm_pipeline` function is defined to create a pipeline for text2text generation. This function:
     - Accepts the input text.
     - Uses the pipeline to process text with defined max and min lengths.
     - Returns the generated text.

4. **Streamlit UI Components:**
   - The user interface is defined with sections for the title, user input, options for summarization and grammar correction, an analyze button, and various headers.
   - Checks are made if the text is present and if summarization or grammar correction options should be executed.

### **Best Practices and Improvements:**

1. **Global Pipeline:**
   - Initialize the `text2text-generation` pipeline outside of the `llm_pipeline` function to avoid reloading it every time the function is called, enhancing performance.
   
     ```python
     pipe_sum = pipeline(
         'text2text-generation',
         model=base_model,
         tokenizer=tokenizer,
         max_length=400,
         min_length=50)

     def llm_pipeline(text):
         result = pipe_sum(text)
         result = result[0]['generated_text']
         return result
     ```

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling for model loading and text processing to manage any possible issues during execution.

    ```python
    try:
        checkpoint = "LaMini-Flan-T5-248M"
        tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
        base_model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
            checkpoint, device_map='auto', torch_dtype=torch.float32)
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error loading model: {str(e)}")
    ```

3. **Improving User Interface:**
   - When the 'Analyze' button is clicked, disable it to prevent multiple submissions until the processing is done, and enable it back once the processing is complete.

    ```python
    if st.button('Analyze', key='analyze_btn'):
        st.session_state.analyze_disabled = True
        ...
    st.session_state.analyze_disabled = False
    ```

4. **Grammar and Typographical Fixes:**
   - Correct the typo `fix_grammer` to `fix_grammar`.

    ```python
    fix_grammar = st.checkbox("Fix Grammatical Errors")
    ```

5. **UI Feedback:**
   - Provide clear notifications about what's happening, especially when the analysis is in progress.

    ```python
    if st.button("Analyze"):
        if user_input:
            with st.spinner('Analyzing...'):
                # Perform analysis
    ```

### **Revised Code Snippet:**

Here is the improved code based on the above recommendations:

```python
# main.py
import streamlit as st
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration, pipeline
import torch
import base64

# Model and tokenizer loading with error handling
try:
    checkpoint = "LaMini-Flan-T5-248M"
    tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
    base_model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
        checkpoint, device_map='auto', torch_dtype=torch.float32)
        
    # Initialize the pipeline globally to avoid reinitialization
    pipe_sum = pipeline(
        'text2text-generation',
        model=base_model,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        max_length=400,
        min_length=50)

except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Error loading model: {str(e)}")

def llm_pipeline(text):
    try:
        result = pipe_sum(text)
        return result[0]['generated_text']
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error during generation: {str(e)}")
        return ""

# Sidebar navigation
st.set_page_config(page_title="Stan: Summarization and Text Analysis", page_icon="‚úíÔ∏è")
st.title("Stan: Summarization and Text Analysis")
st.write("Welcome to Stan, your tool for summarizing and analyzing text.")

# User Input Section
st.header("Input Text")
user_input = st.text_area("Enter the text you want to analyze:", height=200)

# Summarization and Analysis Options
st.header("Summarization and Text Analysis Options")
should_summarize = st.checkbox("Summarize Text")
fix_grammar = st.checkbox("Fix Grammatical Errors")

# Button to initiate analysis
if st.button("Analyze"):
    if user_input:
        with st.spinner('Analyzing...'):
            if should_summarize:
                summary = llm_pipeline(f"Summarize : {user_input} and the summary is :")
                st.subheader("Summary:")
                st.write(summary)
                
            if fix_grammar:
                corrected_text = llm_pipeline(f"Fix the grammatical mistake in the given text : {user_input} and the correct sentence is :")
                st.subheader("Corrected Text:")
                st.write(corrected_text)
    else:
        st.warning("Please enter some text for analysis.")

# About Section
st.header("About Stan")
st.write("Stan is a tool that utilizes large language models for text summarization and answering questions.")
st.write("It works offline, making it a useful resource for text analysis and summarization tasks.")

These adjustments make the code more efficient, improve user interface feedback, and adhere to best practices.

## File: remote_repo/Stan/pages/2_chat.py

This code creates a web app using Streamlit that functions as a chatbot powered by the "CodeLlama-7B-GGUF" language model. The app allows users to interact with the model and get responses to their prompts. Here's a review of the code:

### Overall Structure

1. **Title and Configuration**: The web page is titled "ü¶ôüí¨ Llama 2 Chatbot" using `st.set_page_config`.
2. **Loading the Model**: 
   - The model is loaded via the `ChatModel` function, which is cached using `st.cache_resource` to avoid reloading the model every time the app runs.
3. **Sidebar Configuration**:
   - The sidebar consists of the title, subheader, and sliders for adjusting model parameters like `temperature` and `top_p`. 
4. **Initial Chat State**: 
   - The chat's state is maintained using `st.session_state.messages`.
5. **Display Chat Messages**: 
   - The stored messages are displayed each time the app runs.
6. **Clear Chat History**: 
   - A button in the sidebar clears the chat history.
7. **Generate Model Response**: 
   - The function `generate_llama2_response` constructs a dialogue context and generates a response using the chat model.
8. **Chat Input Handling**:
   - The app waits for user input and appends it to the chat history. If the last message is from the user, it generates a response from the assistant.

### Potential Issues and Improvements

1. **Model File Path**:
   - Ensure the model file `"codellama-7b.Q2_K.gguf"` is correctly located in the expected directory. Otherwise, the model loading will fail.

2. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - The use of `@st.cache_resource` for caching the model is appropriate. However, if the model is large, ensure there is enough memory available for caching.

3. **Redundant Code**:
   - There is a commented line for `max_length` that could either be removed or un-commented if it is intended to be used.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The `generate_llama2_response` function concatenates the entire dialogue for each generation, which can become inefficient for long conversations. Consider optimizing the input prompt construction.
   
5. **Slot for Display Updates**:
   - The use of `st.empty()` allows message updates in real-time and ensures the user sees the response as it is being generated, which is good practice.

6. **Clarity in Prompt Construction**:
   - The prompt includes guidelines for the assistant ("You are a helpful assistant..."). Make sure these guidelines are continually appropriate for all expected interactions.

### Code Execution

If this script is run with Streamlit, it should create a web interface where users can interact with the chatbot in the sidebar and main chat sections. 

### Example Run-through

1. The user opens the web app and sees the title "ü¶ôüí¨ Llama 2 Chatbot".
2. In the sidebar, users can adjust `temperature` and `top_p` settings.
3. The chat initializes with: *"How may I assist you today?"*.
4. The user inputs a prompt, and the chatbot generates a response based on the previous conversation context.
5. The user can clear the chat history using the sidebar button.

### Final Remarks

The code is structured correctly for a Streamlit-based chatbot, leveraging both model caching and session state management for real-time chat interactions. With minor optimizations and checks, it should offer a seamless user experience.

## File: remote_repo/Stan/pages/3_app.py

The provided code appears to be a streamlit-based app for document summarization using a language model. However, there are a few issues and improvements that can be made to ensure it works flawlessly:

1. **Imports & Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed (`streamlit`, `langchain`, `transformers`, `torch`, etc.).
   - `torch_dtype` needs to be imported from `torch`.

2. **File Handling:**
   - The uploaded file is stored in the "data" directory, but it‚Äôs not created if it doesn't exist. To ensure seamless file operations, we should create the directory if it doesn't exist.

3. **Streamlit Cache:**
   - `st.cache_data` is mentioned but doesn't seem appropriate here. Consider using `st.cache` instead for caching functions.

4. **File Path Handling in PDF Loading:**
   - The `file_preprocessing` function assumes direct PDF loading, but we need to handle the file path correctly.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Additional error handling for file operations and model processing to provide user-friendly messages would enhance the user experience.

Here is the revised code:

```python
import streamlit as st
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader, DirectoryLoader
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
from transformers import pipeline
import torch
import base64
import os

# model and tokenizer loading
checkpoint = "LaMini-Flan-T5-248M"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
base_model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    checkpoint, device_map='auto', torch_dtype=torch.float32)

# file loader and preprocessing
def file_preprocessing(file_path):
    loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)
    pages = loader.load_and_split()
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=50)
    texts = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)
    final_texts = ""
    for text in texts:
        print(text)
        final_texts = final_texts + text.page_content
    return final_texts

# LLM pipeline
def llm_pipeline(file_path):
    pipe_sum = pipeline(
        'summarization',
        model=base_model,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        max_length=400,
        min_length=50)
    input_text = file_preprocessing(file_path)
    result = pipe_sum(input_text)
    result = result[0]['summary_text']
    return result

@st.cache
# function to display the PDF of a given file
def displayPDF(file_path):
    # Opening file from file path
    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        base64_pdf = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode('utf-8')

    # Embedding PDF in HTML
    pdf_display = F'''<iframe src="data:application/pdf;base64,{base64_pdf}" width="100%" height="600" type="application/pdf"></iframe>'''

    # Displaying File
    st.markdown(pdf_display, unsafe_allow_html=True)

# streamlit code
st.set_page_config(layout="wide")

def main():
    st.title("Document Summarization App using Langauge Model")

    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your PDF file", type=['pdf'])

    if uploaded_file is not None:
        if st.button("Summarize"):
            col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
            data_dir = "data"
            if not os.path.exists(data_dir):
                os.makedirs(data_dir)
            filepath = os.path.join(data_dir, uploaded_file.name)
            with open(filepath, "wb") as temp_file:
                temp_file.write(uploaded_file.read())
            with col1:
                st.info("Uploaded File")
                displayPDF(filepath)

            with col2:
                summary = llm_pipeline(filepath)
                st.info("Summarization Complete")
                st.success(summary)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Summary of Improvements:
1. Added import for `os` and ensured the ‚Äúdata‚Äù directory is created if it does not exist.
2. Changed `st.cache_data` to `st.cache`.
3. Added file path handling corrections.
4. Streamlined the `displayPDF` function to use `file_path` consistently.

This should ensure the code runs more robustly and handles file paths correctly across different environments.
